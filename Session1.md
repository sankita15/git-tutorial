###Scenario 1: 

Assumption:- You have 3 files in your repository. you need to add them and then commit them locally

1.) What happens internally in git when you add or staged any file changes from your working directory?

2.) What happens internally in git when you commit your staged changes? 

3.) How to revert the locally committed change? (version - no one knows)

4.) How to revert it if its the initial commit :wink: ðŸ˜‰
